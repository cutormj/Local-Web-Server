Certainly! To use a custom hostname like “localserver” instead of an IP address, you can modify the app.run() line in your Flask app. Let’s update it accordingly:

Python

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='localserver', port=8080)
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
By setting the host parameter to 'localserver', your Flask app will be accessible at http://localserver:8080/.

Remember to ensure that your system’s hosts file (usually located at /etc/hosts on Unix-like systems or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts on Windows) includes an entry mapping localserver to 127.0.0.1. You can add the following line to that file:

127.0.0.1   localserver

Now, when you visit http://localserver:8080/, your Flask app should respond as expected. 🚀🌐

Feel free to test it out, and if you have any further questions or need assistance, don’t hesitate to ask—I’m here to help! 😊

And hey, even code wizards like us occasionally need a magical incantation to set the right hostname! 🧙‍♂️🔮✨

Need to make sure that you have OpenSSL on your device
Open Command Prompt
type winget --version
type winget search openssl

then type winget install -e --id <the Id column you choose>
